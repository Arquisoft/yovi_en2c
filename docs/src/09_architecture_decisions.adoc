== Architecture Decisions

This section documents the most significant architectural decisions made during the design and development of the YOVI
platform. Each decision follows the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format to provide context, rationale, and
consequences.

=== 1: Prioritize Early Internationalization (i18n)

* **Status**: Accepted
* **Context**: One of the optional features for the YOVI platform is support for internationalization (i18n). The team
recognized that implementing i18n later in the development cycle is often more complex and costly.
* **Decision**: Internationalization will be integrated into the project's foundation from the start. This includes
structuring the codebase for easy text extraction, using a library, and
designing the UI layout to accommodate variable text lengths.
* **Consequences**:
* **Positive**: Significantly reduces future integration effort, avoids major refactoring of the UI, and allows the
optional feature to be completed with minimal friction.
* **Negative**: Adds initial setup complexity and requires discipline from all developers to use the i18n framework for
all user-facing text from day one.
