== Glossary

This glossary defines the most important **domain and technical terms** used throughout the YOVI project. It ensures that
all stakeholders (developers, client, evaluators, bot developers) have an **identical understanding** of these terms.

=== Domain Terms

[cols="e,3e", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Definition

|YOVI
|The name of the system developed in this project. A web-based platform for playing Game Y, supporting human players and external bots.

|Game Y
|An abstract strategy board game in which players aim to connect three different sides of the board. The game is played on a triangular or hexagonal grid.

|Classic Game Y
|The standard version of Game Y defined by the original rules, without additional variants or optional mechanics. This is the mandatory implementation for the project.

|Game Variant
|An alternative version of Game Y with modified rules, such as Poly-Y, Hex, Tabu Y, or Holey Y. These are optional features.

|Player
|A human user who interacts with the system through the web frontend to play games.

|Bot
|An external program that interacts with the system exclusively through the public API to retrieve information and play games automatically. Bots have no UI.

|Player-versus-Machine (PvM)
|A game mode in which a human player competes against a computer-controlled opponent (AI).

|Match / Game Session
|A single instance of a game, from initialization to completion, including all moves and the final result.

|Move
|A single action by a player placing a piece on the board. Represented in YEN notation.

|Strategy
|A specific algorithm or heuristic used by the AI to determine its next move. Examples: Random, Heuristic, Minimax.

|Difficulty Level
|A configuration of the AI strategy that affects its playing strength. Usually implemented by varying strategy parameters or search depth.

|User Registration
|The process of creating an account in the system, providing username, password, and optionally email.

|Match History
|A record of all games played by a user, including date, opponent (human/bot), result, and moves.

|Statistics
|Aggregated metrics about a user's performance, such as total games played, wins, losses, and win rate.

|Leaderboard
|An optional feature ranking users based on various metrics (win rate, games played, etc.).

|Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
|A document that captures an important architectural decision, including context, rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences. ADRs are stored in the project wiki.

|API Gateway
|A service that acts as a single entry point for all external requests. Routes requests to the appropriate internal service (webapp, users, gamey) and handles SSL termination.

|Microservice
|An architectural style in which a system is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately. YOVI uses three microservices.

|Web Frontend Service (`webapp/`)
|The TypeScript/React service that provides the user interface for human players. Handles game rendering, user interaction, and API calls to backend services.

|User Service (`users/`)
|The Node.js/Express service responsible for user management: registration, authentication, profile storage, match history, and statistics.

|Game Engine Service (`gamey/`)
|The Rust service that implements all Game Y logic: move validation, win condition checking, and AI move calculation with multiple strategies.

|MongoDB
|The NoSQL database used by the User Service to persist user profiles, authentication data, and match history.

|Docker
|A containerization platform used to package each service with its dependencies, ensuring consistent execution across development, test, and production environments.

|docker-compose
|A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Used to orchestrate all YOVI services locally and in production.

|CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
|An automated pipeline (using GitHub Actions) that builds, tests, and deploys the system whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

|GitHub Actions
|The CI/CD platform used for automated testing, building, and deployment of the YOVI system.

|SonarQube
|A code quality analysis tool integrated into the CI pipeline to monitor test coverage, code smells, bugs, and technical debt.

|Prometheus
|A monitoring and metrics collection tool used to gather performance data from all services.

|Grafana
|A visualization tool that creates dashboards from Prometheus metrics, used for monitoring system health.

|JWT (JSON Web Token)
|A compact, URL-safe token used for stateless authentication. Contains user identity and claims, signed with a secret key.

|YEN Notation
|A JSON-based notation used to represent the state of a Game Y match, including board size, current turn, players, and board layout. Mandated by the client.

|REST API
|An architectural style for designing networked applications. YOVI exposes RESTful APIs for all service-to-service and external communication.

|HTTP / HTTPS
|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure). The application-layer protocol used for all communication between clients, bots, and services.

|JSON
|JavaScript Object Notation. A lightweight data-interchange format used for all API payloads, especially YEN notation.

|TypeScript
|A statically typed programming language that extends JavaScript, used to implement the web frontend.

|Rust
|A systems programming language focused on safety and performance, used to implement the game engine.

|Node.js
|A JavaScript runtime used to execute the User Service backend.

|Express
|A web framework for Node.js used to build the User Service REST API.

|React
|A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used in the web frontend.
