= Architecture Constraints

This section lists the main constraints that shape the architecture of the YOVI system. These constraints come from the assignment requirements and limit the available architectural choices.

== Technical Constraints

* The system is composed of at least two subsystems:
** A web application implemented in *TypeScript*.
** A game engine module implemented in *Rust*.

* The Rust module must be exposed as a *web service* so it can be invoked remotely by the web application.

* Communication between the web application and the Rust module must use *JSON messages* following the *YEN notation* for representing the state of a Game Y match.

* The web application must expose a *public API* that allows external bots to interact with the system.

* The complete system must be *deployed and publicly accessible via the Web*.

== Domain Constraints

* The system must implement the rules of *Game Y*. Support for the classic version of the game is mandatory.

* A *player-versus-machine* game mode must be available.

* The game must support a *variable board size*.

* The computer player must implement *more than one strategy*. The user must be able to select the strategy, optionally including different difficulty levels.

== Organizational and Process Constraints

* The architecture and design decisions must be documented following the guidelines used in the course, including the use of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).

* The system must include automated testing at different levels, such as unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

* Development must be carried out using a version-controlled repository, including issue tracking and documented architectural decisions.

* The project should support automated build and deployment through CI/CD pipelines.

== External Constraints

* External bots can only interact with the system through the exposed API and must not depend on internal implementation details.

* The public API must be documented to allow third-party developers to implement compatible bots.

These constraints define the boundaries within which the YOVI architecture has been designed.
