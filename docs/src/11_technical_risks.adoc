== Risks and Technical Debts

This section identifies potential technical risks and anticipated technical debts for the YOVI project. Items are ordered by their estimated impact and probability. For each item, mitigation strategies are proposed.

[options="header",cols="3,2,2"]
|===
| Risk / Technical Debt | Potential Impact | Mitigation Strategy
| **Learning Curve for Rust** | High | Dedicated learning sprint at project start. Use paired programming and focus on
implementing the core game verification module first with extensive testing.
| **Integration Complexity between TypeScript and Rust** | High | Define a clear, versioned JSON interface using YEN
notation early. Create integration tests and contract tests to ensure both modules adhere to the agreed protocol.
| **Incomplete Understanding of Game Y Rules and Variants** | Medium-High | Conduct a formal requirements analysis
session focused solely on the game domain. Create a shared glossary and develop a "walking skeleton" to validate the
core logic early.
| **Scope Creep from Optional Features** | Medium | Prioritize the implementation of mandatory features first. Define
clear "Definition of Done" criteria for each optional feature and only address them after the core system is stable.
| **Technical Debt from Rushed Frontend Decisions** | Medium | Adopt an established component library to ensure
consistency and responsiveness from the start. Enforce code reviews focused on UI structure.
| **Lack of Performance Benchmarking for AI Strategies** | Medium-Low | Define performance budgets for AI move
calculation. Profile the Rust module early with different board sizes and algorithm complexities.
| **API Stability for External Bots** | Medium | Version the public API from the first release. Provide comprehensive
and maintained documentation. Consider implementing API deprecation policies early.
| **Deployment and DevOps Complexity** | Low-Medium | Use containerization (Docker) from the beginning to ensure
environment parity. Automate the deployment pipeline (CI/CD) early to avoid manual deployment "debt."
