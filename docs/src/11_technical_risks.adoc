== Risks and Technical Debts

Following the principle that "risk management is project management for grown-ups" (Tim Lister), we systematically evaluate and track items that could impact project success.

Each item is assessed using a **risk matrix**:

* **Probability**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
* **Impact**: Low (1), Medium (2), High (3)
* **Risk Score** = Probability × Impact (1-9)

Items with score ≥ 6 require active mitigation. Items with score ≥ 8 are critical and require immediate attention.



=== Technical Risks

The following table lists identified technical risks, ordered by **Risk Score** (highest first).

[options="header",cols="1,3,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| ID | Risk Description | Prob (1-3) | Impact (1-3) | Score | Mitigation Strategy
| **R1** | **Rust learning curve** – Team lacks Rust experience | 3 (H) | 3 (H) | **9** | • Learning sprint (week 1) • Pair programming • Focus on core game verification first • Use Rust's type system
| **R2** | **TypeScript-Rust integration** – Communication bugs between services | 3 (H) | 3 (H) | **9** | • Versioned JSON interface (YEN) • Contract tests • Integration tests in CI • OpenAPI docs
| **R3** | **Game Y rules misunderstanding** – Incorrect implementation | 2 (M) | 3 (H) | **6** | • Domain analysis session • Shared glossary • Walking skeleton early • Reference authoritative sources
| **R4** | **Scope creep** – Optional features delay mandatory ones | 2 (M) | 3 (H) | **6** | • MoSCoW prioritization • Clear DoD for optional features • Feature flags
| **R5** | **API stability for bots** – Changes break external bots | 2 (M) | 2 (M) | **4** | • Versioned API (/v1/) • Documentation • Deprecation policy (6 months) • Compatibility tests
| **R6** | **AI performance** – Slow on large boards | 2 (M) | 2 (M) | **4** | • Performance budget (< 2s) • Early profiling • CI performance tests
| **R7** | **DevOps complexity** – Inconsistent deployments | 2 (M) | 2 (M) | **4** | • Docker + docker-compose • CI/CD automation • Environment parity
| **R8** | **MongoDB data loss** – Corruption or deletion | 1 (L) | 3 (H) | **3** | • Daily backups • 30-day retention • Monthly restore tests • Replication
| **R9** | **JWT vulnerability** – Weak secrets or token leakage | 1 (L) | 3 (H) | **3** | • Strong secrets (env vars) • Short expiration (1h) • Refresh tokens • GitHub Secrets
| **R10** | **Gateway single point of failure** – Entire system down if gateway fails | 1 (L) | 3 (H) | **3** | • Stateless design • Multiple instances • Docker restart • Prometheus monitoring

=== Technical Debts

Technical debts are **already incurred** design or implementation shortcuts that need to be addressed. These are tracked separately from risks.

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,2"]
|===
| ID | Debt Description |  Impact if not fixed | Planned Resolution
| **TD1** | **Frontend Component Duplication** – Similar UI components (buttons, modals) are duplicated across files instead of using a shared library  | Medium – Inconsistent UI, harder maintenance | Refactor to use shared component library
| **TD2** | **Hardcoded Configuration** – Some API endpoints are hardcoded in frontend instead of using environment variables | Low – Works in dev but causes issues in prod | Move all configuration to .env files
| **TD3** | **Missing Input Validation** – Some user inputs in forms lack client-side validation | Medium – Poor user experience, extra server load | Add validation to all forms
| **TD4** | **Incomplete Test Coverage** – Some modules have < 70% test coverage |  Medium – Higher risk of undetected bugs | Increase coverage to 80% (per QS-10)
