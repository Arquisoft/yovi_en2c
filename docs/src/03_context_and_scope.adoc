== Context and Scope

This section describes the context of the YOVI system, its external interfaces, and the boundaries between the system and its environment.

== Business Context

YOVI is a web-based platform that allows users to play Game Y against the computer and enables external bots to interact with the system through a public API. The system is intended to be accessed through a web browser or programmatically via HTTP-based interfaces.

The main external actors are:

* *Human players*, who access the system through a web frontend.
* *Bots*, who interact with the system using the exposed API.

The YOVI system depends on a separate game engine module, implemented in Rust, which is responsible for validating game states, checking winning conditions, and suggesting the next move for the computer player.

== Technical Context

From a technical point of view, YOVI consists of a web application and an external game engine service communicating over HTTP.

* The *web application* provides:
  ** A browser-based user interface for human players.
  ** A REST-style API for bot interaction and game management.

* The *game engine service*:
  ** Receives game states encoded in YEN notation.
  ** Evaluates whether a game has been won.
  ** Computes and returns the next move according to the selected strategy.

All communication between the web application and the game engine uses JSON messages following the YEN notation defined for Game Y.

== Scope

The scope of the YOVI system includes:

* Playing Game Y through a web interface.
* Playing against the computer using multiple strategies.
* User registration and access to basic statistics and match history.
* A public API that allows bots to retrieve information and play matches.

The following aspects are explicitly out of scope or optional:

* Support for game variants other than the classic version of Game Y (unless implemented as optional features).
* Mobile applications.
* Advanced social features such as chat or video communication.
* Multiplayer modes involving multiple human players.
