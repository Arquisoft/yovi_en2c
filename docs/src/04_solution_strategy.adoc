== Solution Strategy

The architecture of the application will be designed designed to ensure responsive gameplay, maintainable logic, and high usability, while remaining simple to extend.


-TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS

Programming Language: Rust

Bot Implementation: Heuristic AI to guarantee predictable response times and deterministic behavior.

User Interface: GUI framework to enable clear visualization of game state and give immediate feedback to the player.


-ARCHITECTURAL DECOMPOSITION


We will use Layered Architecture based on the implementation of different microservices:

Presentation Layer: Handles user interaction and visualization

Game Logic Layer: Enforces rules and manages game state

Bot AI Layer: Computes bot decisions independently of UI

Infrastructure Layer: Logging, configuration, and error handling

Database Layer: Stores all the relevant data of the application


-DESIGN PATTERNS AND ARCHITECTURAL STRATEGIES

Model–View–Controller (MVC)
Ensures clear separation between game state, user interface, and control logic.

Strategy Pattern for bot behavior
Allows multiple bot difficulty levels and easy extension without modifying core logic.

Observer Pattern for UI updates
Ensures efficient and consistent propagation of game state changes.

-QUALITY GOAL REALIZATION

Performance: The game must respond in time to player actions.

Usability: UI should be intuitive and players should be able to tell what to do either by the UI or by rules explaining the game.

Scalability: The game must be able to accept changes in the way of playing or accept new features added in the future.

Maintainability: The code should be easy to modify or extend and should have the proper comments and be structured to make it readable.

Reliability: Game can run and tackle exceptions without crashing.

Portability: The game should run on multiple platforms.


-ORGANIZATIONAL AND PROCESS DECISIONS

Development Process: Iterative and incremental to enable early validation of gameplay and bot behavior.

Responsibility Separation: Different layers or microserviecs can be assigned to different developers.

.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.
