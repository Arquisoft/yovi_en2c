== Introduction and Goals

We are a team of four Software Engineering students from the University of Oviedo developing YOVI, a web-based gaming
platform for the company Micrati
as part of our Architecture of Software Systems (ASR) course project.

The platform will allow users to play Game Y against AI opponents with strategies and track
their games via their own account. Our solution is built with a service-oriented
architecture comprising three main components: a React frontend (webapp/), a Node.js user service (users/), and a Rust
game engine (gamey/), all orchestrated via an API gateway. This architecture ensures clarity, maintainability, and
scalability while fulfilling both academic requirements and player expectations.

This document outlines the architectural vision for YOVI, balancing functionality with clarity and maintainability to
meet both academic requirements and player expectations.

=== Requirements Overview


The YOVI system is a web-based gaming platform based on Game Y, developed for the company Micrati. The main goal is to
allow users to play matches against the machine or via bots, with support for registration and statistics functionalities.

Key functional requirements include:

* Public deployment and web accessibility.
* Development of a web application in React that allows playing at least the classic version of Game Y.
* Implementation of a Rust module to verify the game state and suggest moves to the bot.
* User registration and access to match history.
* Support for multiple strategies and difficulty levels in the vs. machine mode.





=== Quality Goals

The main quality attributes for the system architecture are:

- **Functionality**: The system must correctly implement Game Y rules and provide at least one working AI strategies.
- **Usability**: The React-based interface must be intuitive for players. The component-based architecture of the webapp
supports future internationalization (i18n)
- **Modularity & Maintainability**: The clear separation into services ensures that components can be developed, tested,
and extended independently.
- **Deployability & Availability**: Using Docker and Docker Compose ensures that the multi-service application can be
consistently deployed in any environment. The gateway provides a single entry point, simplifying deployment
- **Testability**: The separation of concerns allows for comprehensive testing at multiple levels: unit tests in Rust
and Node.js, integration tests between services, and end-to-end tests for the webapp
