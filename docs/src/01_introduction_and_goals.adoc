== Introduction and Goals

We are a team of four Software Engineering students developing YOVI, a web-based gaming platform for the company Micrati
as part of our Architecture of Software Systems (ASR) course project.

The platform will allow users to play various versions of Game Y against AI opponents with different strategies, track
their performance, and compete through an optional public ranking system. Our goal is to deliver an engaging, intuitive,
and reliable gaming experience that can be extended with new game variants in the future.

This document outlines the architectural vision for YOVI, balancing functionality with clarity and maintainability to
meet both academic requirements and player expectations.

=== Requirements Overview


The YOVI system is a web-based gaming platform based on Game Y, developed for the company Micrati. The main goal is to
allow users to play matches against the machine or via bots, with support for multiple strategies, variable board sizes,
and registration and statistics functionalities.

Key functional requirements include:

* Development of a web application in TypeScript that allows playing at least the classic version of Game Y.
* Implementation of a Rust module to verify the game state and suggest moves, with JSON communication using YEN.
* A documented public API to allow bot interaction.
* User registration and access to match history, statistics, and metrics.
* Support for multiple strategies and difficulty levels in the vs. machine mode.
* Public deployment and web accessibility.




=== Quality Goals

The main quality attributes for the system architecture are:

- **Functionality**: The system must support multiple Game Y variants and allow matches against AI with different
strategies.
- **Usability**: The interface must be intuitive and optionally support internationalization (i18n).
- **Maintainability**: The architecture must facilitate the extension with new game variants without rewriting core
components.
- **Availability**: The application must be deployed and publicly accessible with high availability.
- **Interoperability**: The API must be well-documented and allow integration with external bots via YEN.
